MEDIA STORAGE & DOCUMENT HANDLING
=================================

**Storage Strategy:**
- **Local Storage**: Documents stored in app's Documents directory with Core Data references
- **Cloud Storage**: Firebase Storage handles backup and synchronization
- **Caching**: NSCache manages memory usage for document thumbnails
- **Compression**: Images compressed to 70% quality to reduce storage costs

**Camera Implementation:**
```swift
import AVFoundation
import Vision

class DocumentCameraService {
    private let captureSession = AVCaptureSession()
    private let photoOutput = AVCapturePhotoOutput()
    
    func captureDocument() -> UIImage {
        // Camera capture with Vision framework for automatic document edge detection
        // Automatic perspective correction for better document quality
    }
}
```

**Document Reference System:**
```swift
struct DocumentReference {
    let localPath: String // Local file system path
    let cloudStorageURL: String? // Firebase Storage URL
    let thumbnailPath: String // Compressed thumbnail path
    let fileSize: Int64 // File size for storage management
}
```

        // Check cache first (weather data valid for 10 minutes)
        if let cached = cache.object(forKey: cacheKey) as? CachedWeatherData,
           Date().timeIntervalSince(cached.timestamp) < 600 {
            return cached.data
        }
        
        // Try primary API first, fallback to secondary
        do {
            let weather = try await OpenWeatherService().getCurrentWeather(lat: lat, lon: lon)
            cache.setObject(CachedWeatherData(data: weather, timestamp: Date()), forKey: cacheKey)
            return weather
        } catch {
            // Fallback to Open-Meteo (free, no API key)
            let fallbackWeather = try await OpenMeteoService().getWeatherForecast(lat: lat, lon: lon)
